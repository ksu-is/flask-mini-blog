# flask-mini-blog
This blog is made using Flask and will incorpate an interactive tab for anyone who wants to use the webpage. The goal is to create a simple but eye catching student and career blog that can be used by anyone looking for more information on their future careers, while sharing the IS experiences of Faith and Suriyah. When the blog is successfully ran, it is expected to show organized tabs that are easy to read. One of the tabs will allow students to put in their name and major, and it will give them resume tips that may or may not be specific to them.
